# db2-lifecycle

This repository will be removed shortly. On reflection, I had decided that it was (to use possibly British terms) a half-arsed implementation of a half-baked idea.

A more fully fledged approach is being developed in the ``db2-state-model`` repository.

See branch ``legacy`` here for the old code.
